This project involved creating a time zone converter app so that the user can enter a time, a date, and input time zone and retrieve the input time in a destination time zone of choice.
The project is comprised of two files: 
- index.html - the main application, which displays the user interface and contains convertTime() function
- options.js - for adding options of time zones to the dropdowns via JavaScript (rather than adding &lt;option&gt; to each &lt;select&gt; element in HTML) 
- moment.js and moment-timezone-with-data-10-year-range.js: these are scripts for moment.js library, required for inclusion in order to use moment.tz function in code 
  
  There is a YouTube video associated with this project that shows how to build it, which I will upload soon.
